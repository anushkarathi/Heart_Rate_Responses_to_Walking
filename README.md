Public repository for viewing files relevant to the data collected in walking study at ESTAR Lab. 'Control-Data-Code' will create visuals of stride speed vs. heart rate and metabolic rate vs. heart rate. 'Real-World-Data-Code' visualizes stride speed vs. heart rate and heart rate as observed by the monitor during different activities. 


This repository contains research work on the walking study done at ESTAR Lab through SROP Program at the University of Michigan in summer 2022. This is a public repository to display code and data that was collected by Anushka Rathi.
