# Heart Rate Responses to Walking

This repository contains research work on the walking study done at ESTAR Lab through Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) at the University of Michigan in summer 2022. This is a public repository to display code written by Anushka Rathi. Data for subject 1 is provided. 

<strong>Project Description: </strong>	

This is an independent project based on a larger study analyzing and quantifying walking in the real-world using contextual evidence. 20 participants are asked to walk a week normally in their routine while using wearable technology such as an inertial measurement units (IMU), an accelerometer, and a heart rate monitor. They are told to provide context for their day to day life during this week. After this week, they will participate in the "in-lab" (control) portion of the study in which they are asked to walk at six distinct speeds on a treadmill and overground. These speeds are chosen to replicate speeds observed from their real-world data. 

In my independent project, I am observing the ranges of heart rate displayed by each participant to compare their control and real-world data. My research is aiming to use heart rate data to describe and compare differences in physiological responses based upon context of walking. Using this analysis, I would like to answer if there is a specific context for walking during which humans display the most "ideal response". 

<strong>Notes on Control Data Code: </strong>	

This data is averaging the last 2 minutes of the data collected in both the overground and treadmill trials. The stride speed averages, stride speed standard deviations, and the metabolic cost are calculated by Loubna Baroudi. 

<strong>Notes on Real World Data Code: </strong>	

This data averages the latter 50% of the heart rate displayed during the walking period of the individual. During long walks, it is oberseved that heart rate of the participants stablizes from 50% to 100% of their walks. Therefore, the average and standard deviation of both heart rate and stride speed are calculated in the latter half of the walking duration chosen. 

Specific walks of S1 are chosen, context file is not provided in this repository for privacy reasons.
